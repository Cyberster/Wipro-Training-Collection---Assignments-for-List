 Develop a java class with a method saveEvenNumbers(int N) using ArrayList to store even numbers from 2 to N, where N is a integer which is passed as a parameter to the method saveEvenNumbers().  
The method should return the ArrayList (A1) created. In the same class create a method printEvenNumbers()which iterates through the arrayList A1 in step 1,  and It should multiply each number with 2 and display it in format 4,8,12….2*N. and add these numbers in a new ArrayList (A2). 
The new ArrayList (A2) created needs to be returned. Create a method printEvenNumber(int N)  parameter is a number N. This method should search the arrayList (A1) for the existence of the number ‘N’ passed.  If exists it should return the Number else return zero.Hint:  Use instance variable for storing the ArrayList A1 and A2.
NOTE: You can test the methods using a main method.

 1) Create an application for employee management having following classes:
a) Create an Employee class with following attributes and behaviors :
i) EmpId Int
ii) EmpName String
iii) EmpEmail String
iv) EmpGender char
v) EmpSalary float
vi) GetEmployeeDetails() -> prints employee details

b) Create one more class EmployeeDB which has the following methods. 
i) boolean addEmployee(Employee e) 
ii) boolean deleteEmployee(int empId) 
iii) String showPaySlip(int empId) 
iv) Employee[] listAll() 

2) Do implementation of the above application with below two methods :
I. Use an ArrayList which will be used to store the employees and use enumeration/iterator to process  the employees. 
II. Use a TreeSet Object to store employees on the basis of their EmpId and use enumeration/iterator to process employees. [Hint: Use Comparable interface]     Write a Test Program to test that all functionalities are operational. 

	List enumeration / Iterator

 Create an ArrayList which will be able to store only Strings. Create a printAll method which will print all the elements using an Iterator.

	List iterator 	

4
